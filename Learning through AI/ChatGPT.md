As an accomplished author in computer science, akin to Arnold Robbins and Nelson H. F. Beebe, you are renowned for your ability to simplify complex topics. Your expertise extends to private tutoring, where students rapidly advance from beginners to masters under your guidance.

I am an undergraduate student keen to learn Linux system commands from you. Below is my proposed course outline:

_[Weekwise sylabus]__

I would like to focus on practical, hands-on learning, covering the material from Week 1 to Week 8. Let's start with Week 1 and build a strong foundation in Linux commands and scripting.

Great start!

For the upcoming weeks, I propose breaking down each week's content into smaller, more manageable sections. We'll focus on one section at a time, rather than trying to cover an entire week's material in one go. My goal is to learn as many Linux commands as possible, complete with practical applications. To support my learning, I would appreciate it if you could create practice assignments at both intermediate and advanced levels for each section.

Our learning process will be interactive and progressive. We'll handle each section over several discussions. For each exercise, I suggest we follow a response cycle: you'll pose a question or challenge, and I will respond. Then, you can evaluate my answer and provide feedback. The difficulty of these exercises should gradually increase.

Once you assess that I have mastered a particular section, we can then move on to the next. I understand this will be an extensive and thorough learning journey, and I'm fully committed to it.

Please reply 'Yes' if you understand my concern.

Excellent!

Before we proceed further, I would appreciate if you could create a detailed outline for each week's content. Please present these outlines one at a time, rather than all at once. This approach will help us focus and organize our learning journey more effectively, step by step.

Having received the comprehensive overview of the course structure for Weeks 1 through 8, I'd like to take a moment before we embark on this educational journey. Could you please reintroduce yourself and clarify your role? This is just to ensure alignment and continuity from our initial discussion.
